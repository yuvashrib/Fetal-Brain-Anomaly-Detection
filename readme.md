Identifying abnormalities in the prenatal brain is essential for timely diagnosis and improved prognosis results. In this project, a method for categorizing prenatal brain abnormalities utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Separable Convolution Layers is being proposed.
In recent years, neural networks, especially CNNs, have achieved significant success in image classification tasks, thanks to large-scale labeled datasets and the strong representation abilities of deep neural networks.
Using ultrasound data with 1,786 labeled images spanning various fetal brain anomalies—such as Arnold-Chiari malformation, arachnoid cyst, cerebellar hypoplasia, colpocephaly, encephalocele, holoprosencephaly, hydranencephaly, intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial tumor, mega cisterna magna, ventriculomegaly (mild, moderate, severe), vein of Galen anomaly, and normal cases—our goal is to develop accurate classification models.


To enhance fetal brain anomaly detection, we are exploring not only traditional CNNs but also the use of Separable Convolution Layers. These layers improve feature extraction and classification accuracy by breaking standard convolutions into more efficient depthwise and pointwise operations, boosting both computational efficiency and the model's ability to capture complex spatial relationships in fetal brain images. By fine-tuning pre-trained CNNs with added separable layers, we aim to optimize performance for the specific challenges of anomaly classification. Through comparison with traditional CNNs, we aim to demonstrate the superior accuracy, efficiency, and generalization of Separable CNNs, advancing medical imaging techniques in this field.
This innovative approach shows great potential in advancing prenatal care by facilitating early and accurate detection and classification of fetal brain abnormalities.
